GithubExplorer is a GoLang based web application that allows users to access random Github users information. 
It utilizes the Github API to retrieve data and returns it as a JSON object. 
The application has a simple RESTful interface with a single endpoint that returns an array of users' information. 
The user information includes the username, avatar URL, user type, and URL. The application uses the Gorilla Mux library to handle HTTP requests and routes. 
The application listens on port 8000 and serves the API to all incoming requests.

The app also provides instructions on how to run it using either Docker or Kubernetes, allowing users to choose the best deployment method that fits their needs.
